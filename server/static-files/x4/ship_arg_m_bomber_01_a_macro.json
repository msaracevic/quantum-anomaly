Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"gunboat","storage":{"missile":"40","people":"9","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"880","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"12000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0},"mass":"29.587","inertia":{"pitch":"5.723","yaw":"5.723","roll":"4.578"},"drag":{"forward":"5.443","reverse":"21.773","horizontal":"13.85","vertical":"13.85","pitch":"9.897","yaw":"9.897","roll":"9.897"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
