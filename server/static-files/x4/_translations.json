This combination of factors ultimately lead to Zyarth's downfall. Rhak pursued a gentle, opportunistic approach, halting the conflict with the Curbs, recognising the crucial point in time when Zyarth was at his weakest, and striking him down without hesitation.\\n\\nThis brutal transfer of power is a commonplace occurrence in Split territory.

Additionally, the destruction of the shipyard left their economy crippled. They would have faded away, were it not for the Patriarch of all Split at the time recognising the value of an indebted and fragile family in close proximity to Teladi systems. The Family Tkr was offered protection from the other families by the Patriarch as long as they supplied him with slaves and resources from outside Split space. Split politics are a chaotic affair, and the historic records are muddled, but some scholars have proposed theories that the shipyard incident might not have been an accident, but targeted sabotage, to keep an ambitious family in line.\\n\\nMore recently, Patriarch Zyarth has made significant efforts to fold Family Tkr back into his empire.

The thriving outpost provided the Split with ample workforce and raw resources, and had a significant impact on their military capabilities. During the Gate shutdown and Patriarch Rhonkar's abject failure to hold his empire together, the system quickly became a haven for the Free Families, who were looking to distance themselves from the Split feudal institution. Control over this system allowed Family Tkr to rise to prominence.\\n\\nShortly before tensions between Patriarch Zyarth and the rebellious Free Patriarchs escalated into open conflict, a catastrophic explosion devastated the planet, eradicating the colony and halting production on the outpost completely. Who was responsible for the disaster, as well as the exact cause of the event, is as of yet unknown. All the prevailing theories share in common that a weapons production facility was the epicentre of the explosion.

Patriarch Zyarth has arranged an uneasy alliance with Nhuut, and heavily relies on their military backing to scare the smaller families into obedience.

When Jump Gates shut down, the Teladi in this system were left to their own devices, and their conduct shifted further away from that of the regular Teladi Company. In order to survive the isolation, they increased trade with the Split and tailored their supply to the Split's needs for labour.

biomes.","100501":"Habitat Centre Ring","100502":"Forming the central structural support to the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, this small ring also extends from the Habitat Centre Complex to act as an entrance to the station for any ships that wish to dock.","100601":"Habitat Trade Centre","100602":"These components of the Habitat-class superstation house huge trading floors where official and civilian traders can go to trade wares and produce.","100701":"Habitat Bridge","100702":"As well as acting as secondary support for the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, the bridge also provides high-speed transport from the ring to the complex centre and ring extension, allowing citizens and station workers to travel around the station.","100801":"Sensor
