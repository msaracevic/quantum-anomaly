In an attempt to correct course, the Federation released the Ides. Though they are only slightly aesthetically and technically different, and in fact the Ides is based on the Mercury model, the ship has been pushed as competition to the popular transporter; a marketing strategy that has been well met by the public, and recently allowed for the ship market to find stability.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"transporter","storage":{"missile":"20","people":"19","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"7400","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"5000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0},"mass":"38.67","inertia":{"pitch":"5.676","yaw":"5.676","roll":"4.541"},"drag":{"forward":"6.692","reverse":"26.768","horizontal":"23.944","vertical":"23.944","pitch":"12.167","yaw":"12.167","roll":"12.167"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
