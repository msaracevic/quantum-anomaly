However, the Veles remains a popular choice among traders and station builders.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"freighter","storage":{"unit":"10","missile":"30","people":"110","countermeasure":"20","deployable":"250","capacity":"36000","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_l","hull":"57000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"mass":"440.933","inertia":{"pitch":"175.799","yaw":"175.799","roll":"140.64"},"drag":{"forward":"128.187","reverse":"512.747","horizontal":"95.125","vertical":"95.125","pitch":"155.187","yaw":"155.187","roll":"155.187"},"thrusters":{"size":"large"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":40}},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"large","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"large","quantity":2,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false}
