It is fitted with a non-modular scoop that allows natural gases to be safely placed inside the ship's cargo hold. For all the gratitude received by PMC for their work in advancing asteroid mining, Jonferco's reply sent the mining community into a complete frenzy, with the possibilities for collecting, refining and utilising natural gases spurring the economy, not just in Argon space but across the entire Jump Gate network, to a brand new high.","shortvariation":"ST","type":"miner","storage":{"missile":"20","people":"7","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"12480","capacityType":"liquid"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"5000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"mass":"38.926","inertia":{"pitch":"11.164","yaw":"11.164","roll":"8.932"},"drag":{"forward":"4.709","reverse":"26.909","horizontal":"29.41","vertical":"29.41","pitch":"18.858","yaw":"18.858","roll":"18.858"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
