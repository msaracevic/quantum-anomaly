Notably, the Cerberus was also the first ship of its size to support a fully-functional dock for smaller ships; a massive technical challenge for its designers. This has only made it a more popular choice of ship, and saw a new design race explode throughout the Jump Gate network as other ship designers scrambled to copy the Argons' innovative design.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"frigate","storage":{"unit":"12","missile":"100","people":"14","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"1760","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"17000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"mass":"34.432","inertia":{"pitch":"3.663","yaw":"3.663","roll":"2.93"},"drag":{"forward":"9.164","reverse":"25.659","horizontal":"11.71","vertical":"11.71","pitch":"7.776","yaw":"7.776","roll":"7.776"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":1}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":3},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"specialExit":true}
