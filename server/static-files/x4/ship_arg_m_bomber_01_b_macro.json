Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"ST","variation":"Sentinel","type":"gunboat","storage":{"missile":"40","people":"7","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"1056","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"14000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"mass":"35.505","inertia":{"pitch":"6.578","yaw":"6.578","roll":"5.263"},"drag":{"forward":"6.257","reverse":"25.028","horizontal":"16.62","vertical":"16.62","pitch":"11.376","yaw":"11.376","roll":"11.376"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
