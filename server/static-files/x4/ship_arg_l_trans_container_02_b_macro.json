Though it uses the same base chassis as the Veles, a different container configuration and tweaks to several internal systems to adapt have created a fine addition to the Argon merchant fleet.","shortvariation":"ST","variation":"Sentinel","type":"freighter","storage":{"unit":"10","missile":"30","people":"94","countermeasure":"20","deployable":"250","capacity":"39600","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_l","hull":"64000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0},"mass":"495.78","inertia":{"pitch":"195.962","yaw":"195.962","roll":"156.769"},"drag":{"forward":"139.156","reverse":"556.624","horizontal":"90.977","vertical":"90.977","pitch":"166.156","yaw":"166.156","roll":"166.156"},"thrusters":{"size":"large"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":40}},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"large","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"large","quantity":2,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false}
