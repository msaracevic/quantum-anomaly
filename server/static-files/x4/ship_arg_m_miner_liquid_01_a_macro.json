For all the gratitude received by PMC for their work in advancing asteroid mining, Jonferco's reply sent the mining community into a complete frenzy, with the possibilities for collecting, refining and utilising natural gases spurring the economy, not just in Argon space but across the entire Jump Gate network, to a brand new high.","type":"miner","storage":{"missile":"20","people":"9","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"10400","capacityType":"liquid"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"4000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0},"mass":"30.292","inertia":{"pitch":"9.55","yaw":"9.55","roll":"7.64"},"drag":{"forward":"3.878","reverse":"22.161","horizontal":"24.508","vertical":"24.508","pitch":"16.132","yaw":"16.132","roll":"16.132"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
