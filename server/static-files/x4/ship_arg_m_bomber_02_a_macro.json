Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"RD","variation":"Raider","type":"scavenger","storage":{"missile":"20","people":"15","countermeasure":"8","deployable":"100","capacity":"2370","capacityType":"container"},"radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"13000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"mass":"26.629","inertia":{"pitch":"4.289","yaw":"4.289","roll":"3.431"},"drag":{"forward":"5.036","reverse":"20.146","horizontal":"12.465","vertical":"12.465","pitch":"8.241","yaw":"8.241","roll":"8.241"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":{"capacity":0},"dock_s":{"capacity":0}},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true}
