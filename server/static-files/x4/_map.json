The thriving outpost provided the Split with ample workforce and raw resources, and had a significant impact on their military capabilities. During the Gate shutdown and Patriarch Rhonkar's abject failure to hold his empire together, the system quickly became a haven for the Free Families, who were looking to distance themselves from the Split feudal institution. Control over this system allowed Family Tkr to rise to prominence.\\n\\nShortly before tensions between Patriarch Zyarth and the rebellious Free Patriarchs escalated into open conflict, a catastrophic explosion devastated the planet, eradicating the colony and halting production on the outpost completely. Who was responsible for the disaster, as well as the exact cause of the event, is as of yet unknown. All the prevailing theories share in common that a weapons production facility was the epicentre of the explosion.
