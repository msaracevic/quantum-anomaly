Since the realignment, those Argon citizens who have not yet been captured or killed by the Split have widely started fleeing the system, looking towards the stability and security the Argon Federation can provide them. Many of these refugees are forced to leave behind everything they possess when they set out for safety. Only very few stoic or brave pioneers remain behind to face the encroaching Split.","area":{"sunlight":"1","economy":"0.25","security":"0.7"},"sectors":[{"name":"Eleventh Hour","description":"{20003,4170002}"}],"position":{"x":1125,"y":-86},"sectorsPosition":"singular","owner":"argon"},"Cluster_418_macro":{"name":"Family Nhuut","description":"This sector is the home to Family Nhuut, a very powerful family that has risen to prominence only recently.

When Jump Gates shut down, the Teladi in this system were left to their own devices, and their conduct shifted further away from that of the regular Teladi Company. In order to survive the isolation, they increased trade with the Split and tailored their supply to the Split's needs for labour.

They made Emperor's Pride's (same as {20003, 4240001}) lush, green planet their home. Perhaps it was the great distance to Thuruk's Empire that made them grow peaceful and complacent.
